ofxSandline is an openFrameworks addon that was developed as part of my generative art practise inspired by [a post from Anders Hoff/Inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/2017/grains-of-sand/). It can be [found on Github](https://github.com/sourya-sen/ofxSandLine), alongside examples and documentation.

Some images of it in use are below.
