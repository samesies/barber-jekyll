As part of my Master's thesis, I designed and built a Eurorack compatible hybrid video synthesiser for audiovisual performance and composition.

Developed through an iterative design process, the project consists of a custom hardware interfacing with an Raspberry Pi running an openFrameworks application. It is compatible with Eurorack voltage ranges and can run multiple shaders which can be parameter driven through CV or through the panel controls as well as being sequenced.

Through the development process, the instrument has been both presented at various instances as well as used in live performances (LPM 2018, Rome; Aaniaalto, Helsinki; Eyemyth Festival, Mumbai).

It has been released as an open source project and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/sourya-sen/rPi_synth).

The written thesis is also available to download and can be accessed [here](https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/38068).
