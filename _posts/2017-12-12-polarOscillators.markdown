An audiovisual semi-autonomous system of oscillators mapped in a polar space creating a drone bank as well as evolving visuals. It was developed during the Generative Media Coding workshop taught by Nuno Correia at Aalto Media Lab, 2017.

In more detail, it is a semi autnomous audio visual system using multiple oscillators affected by individual LFOs and mapped in polar coordinates. The oscillators themselves are semi autonomous in nature and traverse the polar space randomly and has in built collision detection. You can also individually move oscillators to designated positions as well as switching off the autonomous behaviour on a per oscillator level.
