ofxCurve is an openFrameworks addon for generating interpolated points on a curve based on a set of control points.

Originally developed as part of the [Aalto Day One](/aalto-day-one) project, it eventually became a full-fledged addon and was subsequently [released on Github](https://github.com/sourya-sen/ofxCurve).
