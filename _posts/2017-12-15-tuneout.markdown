TuneOut is a Spotify-connected, old-school radio developed at the Junction 2017 hackathon in Finland. Using this, one can tune between playlists Spotify has curated for you, like Discover Weekly and Release Radar.

This idea came to us because we were tired of the constant feeling of being "on" that the internet creates, but still loved the widespread functionality it provides.

The code is based around Spotify's API and uses node.js to communicate with the computer's serial port. The radio uses a set of dials and LEDs in a DIY setup. One dial controls the playlist selection, and the other controls the volume in Spotify. The LEDs provide status â€” volume and playlist selection.

For more details as well as the entire codebase, please visit [The Devpost Project Link](https://devpost.com/software/tuneout).

I primarily worked on the hardware side of things and helped in developing the algorithm. The rest of the team comprised of Laura Meskanen-Kundu, Liam Turner, Maya Pillai and Viktoriya Kuznetsova.
