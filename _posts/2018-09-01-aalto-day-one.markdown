For branding of Aalto Day One 2019, I developed elements through a generative art practise which were subsequently used with traditional graphic design practises for the creatives of the event. These included posters and other promotional material, animated versions for displays as well as invites, stickers and more.

The full code, as well as a description of how the code functions, has been released open source and can be found [here](https://github.com/sourya-sen/Aalto_Day_One).

The project was art directed by [Anna Muchenikova](http://annamuchenikova.com) and also had [Babi Brasileiro](http://babibrasileiro.com) and Robynn McPherson for visuals and graphic design. Images courtesy Esa Kapila.
