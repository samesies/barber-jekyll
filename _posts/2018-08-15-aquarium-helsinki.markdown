Over the summer of 2018, we (Jukka Eerikinen, John Lee, Laura Horton and I) developed a permanent installation for the New Children's Hospital in Helsinki. Comprising of a digital display and custom image scanning hardware, it enables children to colour pre-defined fish outlines which can be then scanned into the aquarium where they come to life, swimming around with different behaviours.

The project has been covered in various news outlets and media of which some links are below.

The full code base, as well as releases, can be [found on Github](https://github.com/kids-aquarium/aquarium).
