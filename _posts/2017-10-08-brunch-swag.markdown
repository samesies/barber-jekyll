-Feeling sad and blue
-still embedded with my yellow hues
-slowly warping in the wind
-yellow's truth tries to emboss my blues away--
-aways away
-my last amore becomes pure
-once again i feel the final wave
-slow surges
-revise my blue
-my sludge begins to clot
-and i begin feeling my luminous yellow
-soothe my blues away..
