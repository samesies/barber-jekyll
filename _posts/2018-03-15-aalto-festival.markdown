I was brought into this project to animate the elements developed by [Anna Muchenikova](annamuchenikova.com) and [Babi Brasileiro](http://babibrasileiro.com) as part of the creative team for Aalto Festival 2018. These animated assets were used on the event website (developed by Kokku, which was also featured as site of the day on [Mindsparkle Mag](https://mindsparklemag.com)) as well as in screens across various locations.

Additionally, as part of the festival, I used the animated elements for a projection mapped stage set up during one of the events. This involved creating the projection mapped elements, setting up the stage, and finally, projection mapping and playing them out live.
