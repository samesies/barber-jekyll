I was brought into this project to animate the elements developed by [Anna Muchenikova](annamuchenikova.com) and [Babi Brasileiro](http://babibrasileiro.com) as part of the creative team for Aalto Festival 2018. These animated assets were used on the event website (developed by [Kukko](...), which was also featured as site of the day on ...) as well as in screens across various locations.

Additionally, as part of the festival, I used the animated elements for a projection mapped stage set up during one of the events. This involved creating the projection mapped elements, setting up the stage, and finally, projection mapping and playing them out live.
