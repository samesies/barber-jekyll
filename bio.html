<p>I am an audiovisual artist and creative technologist. Coming from a background in traditional filmmaking and video post production, over the last few I've expanded my practise to work with various software and hardware platforms for expressions in the audiovisual domain working at the intersection of art and technology. I hold an MA in New Media Design and production from Aalto University, Finland and I am currently based in Mumbai, India.
<br>
<p>Oblique is my audio, visual and audiovisual project that sees me explore more artistic aspects of my practise. Starting with VJ performances in 2014, it has now evolved to include both audiovisual performance and music composition and performance. Working primarily with modular synthesisers for audio and custom solutions for video, the performances and compositions are both forward facing and rooted in the past, exploring experimental and traditional aesthetics, ideologies and techniques.</p>
