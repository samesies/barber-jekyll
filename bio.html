<p>I am an audiovisual artist and creative technologist. My interests lie in generative visuals, hybrid instruments and finding emergent patterns at the intersection of art and technology, chaos and order, and noise and music. Coming from a background in traditional filmmaking and VJing, I am currently exploring the intersecting points of behaviour that are away from traditional notions of audiovisual synchronicity, content creation and interaction, using a host of tools, platforms and techniques. I hold an MA in New Media Design and Production from Aalto University, Finland and am currently based in Kolkata, India.</p>
<br>
<p>I have been using the Oblique identity since 2014 for VJ performances, which have now evolved to include both audiovisual performances as well as sound and (electronic) music composition and performance. Working primarily with modular synthesisers, the performances and compositions are both forward facing and rooted in the past, with exploring both the experimental and tradtional aesthetics, ideologies and techniques.</p>
