<p>Sourya Sen/Oblique is an audiovisual artist, creative coder and hardware hacker. His interests lie in generative visuals, hybrid instruments and finding emergent patterns at the intersection of art and technology, chaos and order, and noise and music. Coming from a background in traditional filmmaking and VJing, he is currently expanding his practice to explore the intersecting points of behaviour that are away from traditional notions of audiovisual synchronicity, content creation and interaction using a host of tools, platforms and techniques. He holds an MA in New Media Design and Production from Aalto University, Finland and is currently based in Kolkata, India.</p>

<p>Formerly a VJ, the Oblique identity has now evolved to include both audiovisual performances (2017-18) as well as sound and music composition and performance (2018 onwards). Working primarily with a modular synthesiser, it is a dialogue of the experimental and traditional with aesthetics, ideologies and techniques both equally forward facing and rooted in the past. Oblique's performances and compositions travel through complexity and simplicity, exploring sonic characteristics and narrative structures bound together in the ideas of the ambient and avant garde.</p>
